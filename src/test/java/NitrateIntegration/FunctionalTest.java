 /**
* To run this test, you should run project beforehand and keep it running
* (this selenium doesn`t run project, it assumes it is running and
* connects to localhost:8080/, so e.g. in Netbeans hit Run project and afterwards test
* project).
*
* Also, you need create a job before testing, with following parameters:
*
* Name: selenium_test, multiconfiguration, check This build is parametrized
* and enter file location test.xml, add one Axis Arch and values i386 and
* x86_64, check Integration with Nitrate TCMS and fill values.
*
* This setting (parametrized build) will require file before building, so
* make sure you have testng xml file to upload and that path is correct (
* see line driver.findElement(By.name("file")).sendKeys("") below).
*
* Don`t forget to create Java class PrivatePassword with your username
* and password - they are obviously not part of repo.
