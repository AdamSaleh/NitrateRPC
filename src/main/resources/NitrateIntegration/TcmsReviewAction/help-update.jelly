        Environment group is not mandatory, but without it you can`t link
        Jenkins`s axes to env. vars in TCMS. Fill in the field and check 
        env. vars.

        <p>
        All other settings work the same as in global project settings, with one notable exception,
        that they won't get updated, if they don't pass the check against data in TCMS.
