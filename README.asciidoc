v1.0, 2012-06

This plugin allows easy upload of test results to Nitrate TCMS 
(http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Nitrate). After initial configuration, after each 
build new action appears, from where you can review, change and upload results 
directly to TCMS server. Results are parsed from TestNG xml files. 

Features
--------
* Supports both freestyle and multiconfiguration projects
* Jenkins`s build variables (and build axes in multiconf project) are mapped to 
  environment variables in TCMS - user can create custom mapping (deselect some, 
  rename)
* Supports Kerberos authentication

For developers

problems with downloading dependencies from Jenkins repository.
